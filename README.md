# Product Tracker

An application designed to easily track and manage web applications developed and maintained by the Province of BC.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

```JSON
"eslint": "8.36.0",
"eslint-config-next": "13.2.4",
"next": "13.2.4",
"react": "18.2.0",
"react-dom": "18.2.0",
"react-tooltip": "^5.10.1",
"sass": "^1.60.0",
"uuid": "^9.0.0"
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser!

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api/products](http://localhost:3000/api/products).

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
